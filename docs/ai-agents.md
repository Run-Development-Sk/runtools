# Coding AI Agents

The following coding AI agents are available in devcontainer:

- **Claude Code** (VS Code extension) and/or `claude` (Claude Code CLI)
- `auggie` (**Augment Code** CLI)
- **Codex** (VS Code extension) and/or `codex` (Codex CLI)
- `agy` (**Antigravity** CLI)

You can download the current version for a given project from [github.com/RunDevelopmentSk/devcontainers](https://github.com/RunDevelopmentSk/devcontainers) > `features/ai-agents`.

Details on how to use individual AI agents are described below.

## Unified configuration

**File `AGENTS.md` and contents of `.agents/` folder is used as one source of truth** for project instructions, rules, commands, skills and subagents across all agents:

- [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) in the root directory – main project instructions in the standard [agents.md](https://agents.md/) format. Accepted by:
  - `claude` (symlink `CLAUDE.md`)
  - `auggie`
  - `codex`
  - `agy`
- [`.agents/rules/`](../.agents/rules/) – modular workspace rules. Accepted by:
  - `claude` (reference in `AGENTS.md`)
  - `auggie` (via `.augment/rules`, see [temporary workaround](#temporary-workaround-materialized-rules) below)
  - `codex` (reference in `AGENTS.md`)
  - `agy`
- [`.agents/commands/`](../.agents/commands/) – custom slash commands shared across agents; each `<name>.md` file creates a `/name` command. Accepted by:
  - `claude` (symlink `.claude/commands`)
  - `auggie`
- [`.agents/skills/`](../.agents/skills/) – cross-tool skills in the standard [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/) format. Accepted by:
  - `claude` (symlink `.claude/skills`)
  - `auggie`
  - `codex`
  - `agy`
- [`.agents/agents/`](../.agents/agents/) – subagents shared across agents. Accepted by:
  - `claude` (symlink `.claude/agents`), `.md` format
  - `auggie`,`.md` format
  - `codex` (symlink `.codex/agents`), `toml` format
- [`.agents/mcp_config.json`](../.agents/mcp_config.json) – shared JSON configuration of MCP servers. Accepted by:
  - `claude` (symlink `.mcp.json`)
  - `agy`

The commands to create symbolic links are (the path to the linked folder or file is always relative to the location of the link):

```sh
ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md
ln -s ../.agents/rules .augment/rules
ln -s ../.agents/commands .claude/commands
ln -s ../.agents/skills .claude/skills
ln -s ../.agents/agents .claude/agents
ln -s ../.agents/agents .codex/agents
ln -s .agents/mcp_config.json .mcp.json
```

### Temporary workaround: materialized rules

`auggie` (via `.augment/rules`) fails to read any files through a **symlinked directory** — it silently reports zero rules, with no error. A real (non-symlinked) directory in the same location is read correctly. This looks like the tool resolving directory entries by their raw, non-dereferenced type, under which a symlinked directory is reported as neither a file nor a directory and gets silently skipped.

Until this is fixed upstream, [`.devcontainer/post-start-ai-agents.sh`](../.devcontainer/post-start-ai-agents.sh) (wired into `.devcontainer/post-start.sh`) replaces the symlink with a real directory containing a fresh copy of the source `.md` files (`.gitkeep` excluded) on every container start. `.augment/rules` is therefore a plain, gitignored directory in this repo, not a symlink — the `ln -s ../.agents/rules .augment/rules` command above only applies once the workaround is dropped.

The `materialize_dir` call in `post-start-ai-agents.sh` takes a `true`/`false` (`1`/`0`) flag, so it can be switched back to a plain symlink (`false`) — useful for re-testing whether the underlying bug is fixed.

**After editing `.agents/rules/`, reopen the devcontainer** (so `postStartCommand` re-runs) to get the changes copied into `.augment/rules` — editing the materialized copy directly has no effect, it gets overwritten on the next container start.

### Naming convention

Local/shared/project-owned rules, commands, skills, and subagents are namespaced with a `run.` / `run-` prefix so they are clearly distinguishable from third-party or vendor-provided artifacts (e.g. `speckit-*`), which stay unprefixed and must never be renamed:

- **rules** (`.agents/rules/run.<name>.md`), **commands** (`.agents/commands/run.<name>.md`), **subagents** (`.agents/agents/run.<name>.md` / `.toml`) use a dot-separated `run.<name>` file name,
- **skills** (`.agents/skills/run-<name>/SKILL.md`) use a hyphen-separated `run-<name>` directory name; the skill's frontmatter `name:` matches the directory name.

Avoid double-prefixing (`run.run.<name>`, `run-run-<name>`). A command that is a thin entry point to a skill shares the same base name across both prefix styles (e.g. command `/run.add-agent-asset` <-> skill `run-add-agent-asset`).

### Rules

Workspace rules are in `.agents/rules/*.md` (Markdown with optional YAML frontmatter). Discovery by agent:

| Agent       | Discovery                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Antigravity | natively reads `.agents/rules/*.md`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Auggie      | reads `.augment/rules`, materialized as a real directory ([temporary workaround](#temporary-workaround-materialized-rules))                                                                                                                                                           |
| Claude Code | has a native rules folder (`.claude/rules/*.md`, supports symlinks and path-scoping), but it is not wired into this setup – rules are imported from `AGENTS.md` via `@.agents/rules/<file>.md` as needed, so `AGENTS.md` stays the single place that selects which rules always apply |
| Codex       | has no rules folder; references from `AGENTS.md` via `.agents/rules/<file>.md` as needed                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Auggie and Antigravity use **different frontmatter keys**, but each ignores unknown keys – thus the files work in both from a single location. Auggie distinguishes `type: always_apply|agent_requested`; Antigravity uses `trigger: always_on|glob (+ globs:)|model_decision|manual`. For `agent_requested` / `model_decision`, the agent decides on activation based on the `description:`. Both frontmatter blocks can be combined in a single file.

Example of a compatible file:

```markdown
---
description: Short description of when the agent should consider this rule
type: agent_requested
trigger: model_decision
---

# Rule Name

- Specific rule or convention.
- …
```

### Hierarchical (nested) `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`

Beyond the root-level file, all four agents can read `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` placed in **subdirectories** and treat them as directory-scoped (they apply only when the agent works inside that folder / subtree). This scoping is a matter of _which context gets loaded_, not a hard enforcement — the agent receives the nested rules as text and is expected to respect them; on root-vs-subfolder conflicts the model may not always pick the intended one. Discovery by agent:

| Agent       | Nested `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` | Directory-scoped? | How they are loaded                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Auggie      | yes, natively                    | yes, hierarchical | When working on a file, Auggie looks for `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` in the file's directory and **walks up** to parent directories through the workspace root. Branches off that path do not apply.                                  |
| Claude Code | yes                              | yes               | The root `CLAUDE.md` is loaded at session start; nested files (below cwd) are loaded **lazily / on demand** — only when Claude reads or edits a file in that subtree. Sibling directories are not loaded.                           |
| Codex       | yes, natively                    | yes, hierarchical | Codex walks from the project root **down to the current working directory**, concatenating files (root → down); files closer to cwd override earlier ones. At most one file per directory (`AGENTS.override.md` takes precedence).  |
| Antigravity | yes, but **off by default**      | yes (when on)     | Must be enabled via "Load nested AGENTS.md files" (Settings → Agent). Without it, only the root `AGENTS.md` / `GEMINI.md` plus the global `~/.gemini/` files are read. Nested rules **supplement** (do not replace) the root rules. |

Important caveats:

- **Codex discovery is cwd-based, not edited-file-based.** Codex collects `AGENTS.md` only along the path from the project root to the directory it was launched from. If you start `codex` at the repo root and it edits `sub/module/`, it will **not** load `sub/module/AGENTS.md` — this is [intended behavior](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/13288), not a bug. Auggie and Claude Code, by contrast, follow the file actually being worked on.
- **"Applies only to this folder" is not sandboxed.** For every agent the content is merely appended to the context and the model is expected to honor it. On contradictory root-vs-subfolder rules "flapping" occurs (sometimes the root wins, sometimes the deeper file). The recommended practice is to **state the scope in plain English at the top of each nested `AGENTS.md`** (e.g. "These rules apply only to `services/api/`.") and to phrase the root file as project-wide.
- **Only `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` are hierarchical.** The modular rules under `.agents/rules/` (resp. `.augment/rules/`) are **not** discovered per subdirectory — they are anchored at the workspace root and pulled into the root `AGENTS.md` by reference (`@.agents/rules/<file>.md`). A rule meant for a single subdirectory therefore belongs in an `AGENTS.md` inside that subdirectory (and, for `agy`, only with nested loading enabled), not in `.agents/rules/`.

### Commands

Custom slash commands are in `.agents/commands/*.md` (Markdown; each file creates a `/<name>` command). Discovery by agent:

| Agent       | Discovery                                                                                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Auggie      | via the `.claude/commands` compatibility fallback (no dedicated `.augment/commands` symlink needed)     |
| Claude Code | via symlink `.claude/commands → ../.agents/commands`                                                    |
| Antigravity | **not supported** by the `agy` CLI; workflows, its closest equivalent, only work in the Antigravity IDE |
| Codex       | **not supported**                                                                                       |

### Subagents

Shared subagents are defined in `.agents/agents/`. Since Claude Code and Auggie use **Markdown** (`.md`) and Codex uses **TOML** (`.toml`), the directory contains both formats for each subagent (`<name>.md` + `<name>.toml`). Each agent selects files in the format it recognizes during discovery and ignores the others.

**Formats:**

- **`.md` (Claude Code, Auggie):** YAML frontmatter with `name` (Claude), `description` (both), `color` (Auggie) fields, optionally `tools` and `model` (Claude); `tools` is a comma-separated string (e.g. `tools: Read, Grep, Glob`), not a YAML list. The body of the file is the system prompt.
- **`.toml` (Codex):** `name`, `description`, `developer_instructions` (system prompt) fields, optionally `model`, `sandbox_mode`.

**Antigravity** currently does not support file-defined subagents (only dynamic creation via `define_subagent` tool at runtime). If Google officially introduces this, we will add it.

**Auggie** reads subagents directly from `.agents/agents/`. They can also be created via the `/agents` wizard in interactive mode.

### What remains agent-specific

The following files and directories cannot be unified into `.agents/` or symlinked (different formats, naming, or discovery mechanisms). Details on each item are in the [Auggie](#auggie), [Claude Code](#claude-code), [Antigravity](#antigravity), and [Codex](#codex) sections below.

| Agent           | Specific artifacts (not covered by unified configuration)                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Auggie**      | `.augment/settings.json` (+ `.local`), `.augmentignore`; MCP via `auggie mcp` subcommands or `--mcp-config`                                                                                           |
| **Claude Code** | `CLAUDE.local.md` (private, gitignored), `.claude/settings.json` (+ `.local`; permissions/env/hooks)                                                                                                  |
| **Antigravity** | `GEMINI.md` (alternative workspace context), `.agents/hooks.json` (lifecycle hooks)                                                                                                                   |
| **Codex**       | `AGENTS.override.md` (per-dir override), `.codex/config.toml` (model/sandbox/MCP/hooks), `.codex/hooks.json`, `.codex/rules/*.rules` (sandbox allow/block), `.agents/plugins/` + `plugins/` (plugins) |

**MCP**: shared JSON configuration is in `.agents/mcp_config.json` (for both Claude Code and Antigravity via the `.mcp.json` symlink above). Auggie configures MCP servers via `~/.augment/settings.json` (commands `auggie mcp add|add-json|list|remove`) or ad-hoc `--mcp-config`; sharing via `.agents/mcp_config.json` is not directly possible (different format). Codex uses TOML – `[mcp_servers]` in `.codex/config.toml` – sharing via symlink is not possible.

**Hooks** (lifecycle interceptors – `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop` etc.):

| Agent           | File (project-level)                                                | Format                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Antigravity** | `.agents/hooks.json`                                                | `{ "hooks": { "PreToolUse": [{ "matcher": "…", "hooks": […] }] } }` |
| **Claude Code** | `.claude/settings.json` (or `.claude/settings.local.json`)          | `{ "hooks": { "PreToolUse": [{ "matcher": "…", "hooks": […] }] } }` |
| **Codex**       | `.codex/hooks.json` **or** inline `[hooks]` in `.codex/config.toml` | JSON (same schema) / TOML: `[[hooks.PreToolUse]]`                   |
| **Auggie**      | `.augment/settings.json` (or `.augment/settings.local.json`)        | `{ "hooks": { "PreToolUse": [{ "matcher": "…", "hooks": […] }] } }` |

The JSON schema for hooks is almost identical between Antigravity, Claude Code, and Auggie – only the file location differs. Codex also offers an equivalent TOML syntax; if both `hooks.json` and inline `[hooks]` exist in the same layer, Codex loads both and issues a warning – one per layer is recommended.

### Notes

- **Windows**: git symlinks work reliably on Linux/macOS. The devcontainer runs on Linux, so this issue is avoided. For a native Windows clone, `git config core.symlinks=true` is required, and the user must have `SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege` and all directories must be set as safe ones:
  - Set `git config --global core.symlinks true` - this only needs to be done once globally, at the beginning.
  - Turn on "Settings" (`Win + I`) > "System" > "Advanced" > "For developers" - this only needs to be done once globally, at the beginning.
  - Set `git config --global safe.directory '*'` - this only needs to be done once globally, at the beginning.
- **Local overrides**: files matching `*.local.md`, `*.local.json`, `*.local.toml` are in `.gitignore` – use them for your private notes/settings that do not belong in the repository.
- **Skill format**: each skill is a `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` directory with YAML frontmatter `name` and `description` (a common requirement for Auggie CLI, Codex, and Antigravity).
- **Antigravity tmp files**: Antigravity occasionally references files created in the `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain` directory. To simplify access to these files, a symlink is created: `tmp/antigravity → ~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain`.
- **AI agent terminal label**: If you run multiple agents in separate VS Code terminals, rename each terminal (`F2`) to the agent's name so you can tell them apart at a glance.

The sections below describe installation, logging in, as well as all configuration options for individual agents.

## Plans

Every agent is used through a personal account (your individual login with the provider, see
"Logging In" sestions below). Which **plan** pays for that usage is a separate choice:

- **Individual plan** – an individually paid, capped tier tied to your personal account (private
  use).
- **Company plan** – a shared, company-paid tier your personal account is added to as a member
  (work use); either metered API billing (pay per use) or a flat seat-based subscription (with
  pay-as-you-go overflow once included credits are exhausted).

The following notes summarize subscription options and their relative value, as of July 2026:

- `claude`
  - [Individual plan](https://claude.ai/):
    - 1 seat
    - free credits based on subscription plan, with 5-hour and weekly reset window
  - [Company API plan](platform.claude.com) (metered API billing):
    - unlimited seats
    - "pay as you go"
  - [Company subscription plan](https://claude.com/pricing#team-&-enterprise)
    - from 5 to 150 seats
    - when plan credits are exhausted then "pay as you go"
      - free plan account has no free credits
- `auggie`
  - [Company plan](https://app.augmentcode.com/) (seat-based subscription; $100/month plan):
    - up to 50 seats for purchased shared credits
    - when purchased credits are exhausted then "pay as you go"
- `codex`
  - [Individual plan](https://chatgpt.com/) (Personal plan):
    - 1 seat
    - free credits based on subscription plan, with 5-hour and weekly reset window
      - even **free plan account has available free credits**
  - [Company subscription plan](https://chatgpt.com/) (seat-based subscription; Business plan):
    - unlimited seats
    - "pay as you go" ("Codex" seats) or "subscripion" falling back to "pay as you go" ("ChatGPT" seats)
- `agy`
  - [Individual plan](accounts.google.com):
    - 1 seat
    - a small amount of free credits, with a weekly reset window
    - an API requests limit
  - [Company plan](https://console.cloud.google.com/) (metered API billing; personal account + project + billing + API enabled):
    - unlimited seats
    - $300 of initial free credits included, then "pay as you go"
    - the most cost-effective setup is often to keep each user on a separate, individually-owned Company plan to multiply the $300 free credits and also reduce the API requests.

Approximate value ranking, depending on the models in use (July 2026):

- `agy` > individually-owned Company plan > until the initial $300 is used up
- `codex` > "Individual plan" or "Company plan" + "ChatGPT" seats
- `claude` > Individual plan
- `auggie` > Company plan
- `claude` > Company plan
- `codex` > Company plan

## Claude Code

### Installation

The VS Code extension is installed **automatically** in the devcontainer using `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` > `"customizations"` > `"vscode"` > `"extensions"` > `"anthropic.claude-code"`.

The CLI (`claude`) is installed **automatically** in the devcontainer using `.devcontainer/post-create-ai-agents.sh` > `# install Claude Code CLI`.

### Logging In

#### Company subscrition plan

In this plan you use prepaid credits (constrained to 5 hours / 1 weeks windows) with a fallback to pay as you go.

You need to create a personal account on [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) (Individual plan). For private use, pay for one of [individual plans](https://claude.com/pricing). **For work use**, request to have your personal user added to the [company users](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/members) (Company plan).

When logging into `claude` > `/login`, select `1. Claude account with subscription · Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise`, use the personal account created on [claude.ai](https://claude.ai), and choose the right organization.

On the Company plan, you can track [credits consumed by individual users](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/usage).

##### Initial Company plan setup

You need to create an account on [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) and pay for [team plan](https://claude.com/pricing#team-&-enterprise):

- [Turn on usage credits](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/usage) to allow "pay as you go" fallback.
- [Set email domains associated with your organization](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/organization) > "Domains"
- [Invite members](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/members) or [send invitation link](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/organization) > "Invite link"

#### Company API plan

In this plan you pay as you go. API key are generated automatically on each Claude Code login. But there is also possibility to create API key manually if needed.

You need to create a personal account on [platform.claude.com](https://platform.claude.com/) (Individual plan). For private use, pay for one of the plans. **For work use**, request to have your personal user added to the [company users](https://platform.claude.com/settings/members) (Company plan; with the role `Claude Code` or `Developer`).

When logging into `claude` > `/login`, select `2. Anthropic Console account · API usage billing`, use the personal account created on [platform.claude.com](https://platform.claude.com/), and choose the organization.

On the Company plan, you can track [credits consumed by individual users](https://platform.claude.com/cost?group_by=key_id).

### Commands

Commands ("slash commands") for standard work with the `claude` CLI are:

- **select model:** `/model`
- **set default model:** no separate action needed — the model selected via `/model` persists across sessions
- **allow full permissions:**
  - fast version: `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`
  - slower version: `/config` > `Default permission mode` > `Auto`, or toggle on the fly using `Shift Tab`
  - controlled version: `/permissions` > `Allow`|`Ask`|`Deny`|... > `Bash`, `Bash(npm *)`, `Edit`, `Edit(src/**)`, `Write`, `Read`, `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`, `NotebookEdit`, `Skill`, `Workflow`, `Monitor`, ...
- **new line in prompt:** `Alt Enter`
- **select conversation:** `/resume`
- **new conversation:** `/clear`
- **rename conversation:** `/rename`
- **save conversation:** saves automatically
- **compact conversation:** `/compact`
- **create a copy of conversation:** `/branch`, to come back to parent conversation use `resume`
- **fork conversation:** `/fork`, to come back to parent conversation use arrow left (`<-`) on empty promt line, see [docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/commands) > `/fork`
- **copy last response:** `/copy`, `/copy [N]` to select a specific response
- **save conversation to file:** `/export`, you can also use the added `/run.save-chat` command. Before running `/run.save-chat`, it is recommended to create a copy of the conversation using `/branch` so that the history of the original conversation remains untouched
- **code-review:** `/code-review` or you can use the added `/run.review-changes` command or `/run-review-changes` skill
- **list and select skill:** `/skills`
- **show usage/credits:**
  - `/usage` – current 5h and week window token usage
  - web: [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/) → profile → Settings → Usage
- **update:** `claude update`
- **debugging:** `claude --debug-file ./claude-debug.log`
- **exit work:** `/exit`

| `.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` | Skills: repeatable workflows, checklists, and specialized knowledge.                        | Skills can be called via `/skill-name`; both `.claude/commands/*.md` and `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` create a slash command.

| `.gitignore`                      | Protection against committing local Claude files and sensitive data.                        | To block Claude Code from accessing sensitive files, also use `permissions.deny` in `.claude/settings.json`.

## Auggie

### Installation

The CLI (`auggie`) is installed **automatically** in the devcontainer using `.devcontainer/post-create-ai-agents.sh` > `# install Auggie CLI (Augment Code)`.

### Logging In

You need to create a personal account on [app.augmentcode.com](https://app.augmentcode.com/). For private use, pay for one of the plans (Individual plan). **For work use**, request to have your personal user added to the [company users](https://cosmos.augmentcode.com/account/team) (Company plan).

When logging into `auggie`, use the personal account created on [app.augmentcode.com](https://app.augmentcode.com/).

On the Company plan, you can track [credits consumed by individual users](https://app.augmentcode.com/organization-dashboard).

### Commands

Commands ("slash commands") for standard work with the `auggie` CLI are:

- **select model:** `/model`
- **set default model:** `/config` > `Default Model` > `Claude Sonnet ...`
- **allow full permissions:**
  - `auggie` has full permissions in the default configuration
  - controlled version: `/permissions` > `A` > `Locals settings (personal)` > ...
- **new line in prompt:** `Alt Enter`
- **select conversation:** `/sessions`, here conversations can also be deleted
- **new conversation:** `/new`
- **rename conversation:** `/rename <name>`
- **save conversation:** saves automatically
- **compact conversation:** has no built-in command
- **create a copy of conversation:** `/fork`, to come back to parent conversation use `/sessions`
- **copy last response:** `/copy`
- **save conversation to file:** has no built-in command, but you can use the added `/run.save-chat` command. Before running `/run.save-chat`, it is recommended to create a copy of the conversation using `/fork` so that the history of the original conversation remains untouched
- **code-review:** has no built-in command, but you can use the added `/run.review-changes` command or `/run-review-changes` skill
- **list and select skill:** `/skills`
- **show usage/credits:** no built-in command; view consumption on the [web dashboard](https://app.augmentcode.com/account/analytics)
- **update:** `auggie update`
- **debugging:** `auggie --log-level debug --log-file ./auggie-debug.log` ([docs](https://docs.augmentcode.com/cli/reference#diagnostics)). Useful e.g. to debug indexing failure (to identify problematic files)
- **exit work:** `/exit`

See also other added commands in `.agents/commands` and skills in `.agents/skills`.

## Codex

### Installation

The VS Code extension is installed **automatically** in the devcontainer using `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` > `"customizations"` > `"vscode"` > `"extensions"` > `"openai.chatgpt"`.

The CLI (`codex`) is installed **automatically** in the devcontainer using `.devcontainer/post-create-ai-agents.sh` > `# install Codex CLI`.

### Logging In

#### Company subscription plan

In this plan you use prepaid credits (constrained to 5 hours / 1 weeks windows) with a fallback to pay as you go.

You need to create a personal account on [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com/) (Individual plan). **Codex can also be used for free** via your free personal GPT account, but you must expect limits and availability based on capacity, or you can pay for one of the [plans](https://chatgpt.com/pricing/). **For work use**, request to have your personal user added to the [company users](https://chatgpt.com/admin/members) (Company plan).

When logging into `codex`, select `1. Sign in with ChatGPT` (or `2. Sign in with Device Code` if the first option does not work), use the personal account created on [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com/), and select company/organization when logging in via the browser.

On the Company plan, you can track [credits consumed by individual users](https://chatgpt.com/admin/usage).

##### Initial Company plan setup

You need to create an account on [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com/) and pay for [business plan](https://chatgpt.com/pricing/?type=team):

- [Invite members](https://chatgpt.com/admin/members), seat type must be "ChatGPT".
- [Allow automatic reload of credits](https://chatgpt.com/admin/billing?tab=plan) > "Credits balance" > "Automatic reload"

#### Company API plan

In this plan you pay as you go. There are two possible way of "pay as you go":

1. The same as "Company subscription plan" but the invited members seats are set to "Codex". No API keys are generated, the company pays for spent credits (there are no prepaid).
2. You need to create an account on [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) (Campany plan). you generate API key manually and provide them to team members

### Commands

Commands ("slash commands") for standard work with the `codex` CLI are:

- **select model:** `/model`
- **set default model:** no separate action needed — the model selected via `/model` persists across sessions
- **allow full permissions:**
  - fast version: `codex --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`
  - slower version: `/permissions` > `Full Access`
- **new line in prompt:** `Alt Enter`
- **select conversation:** `/resume`
- **new conversation:** `/new`, `/clear`
- **rename conversation:** `/rename`
- **save conversation:** saves automatically
- **compact conversation:** `/compact`
- **create a copy of conversation:** `/fork`, to come back to parent conversation use `/resume`
- **copy last response:** `/copy`
- **save conversation to file:** has no built-in command, but you can use the added `$run-save-chat` skill. Before running `$run-save-chat`, it is recommended to create a copy of the conversation using `/fork` so that the history of the original conversation remains untouched
- **code-review:** has no built-in command, but you can use the added `$run-review-changes` skill
- **list and select skill:** `/skills` or start typing by `$`
- **show usage/credits:**
  - `/status` – current 5h and week window token usage
  - `/statusline` – customization of a persistent status line showing live usage in the terminal
- **update:** `codex update`
- **debugging:** `RUST_LOG=debug codex -c log_dir=./.codex-log`
- **exit work:** `/exit`

See also other added skills in `.agents/skills`. The added commands in `.agents/commands` are not supported in the `codex` CLI.

| `.codex/config.toml`                         | Project settings for Codex: model, approvals, sandbox, MCP servers, inline hooks, skill overrides, subagent settings. | Codex uses `~/.codex/config.toml` for user config and `.codex/config.toml` for project overrides; project `.codex/` layers are loaded only in trusted projects. ([OpenAI Developers][codex-2])                         |
| `.codex/hooks.json`                          | Lifecycle hooks for the project, e.g., prompt validation, logging, checks after a tool call, or at the end of a turn. | Codex looks for hooks alongside active config layers as `hooks.json` or inline `[hooks]` in `config.toml`; project hooks are loaded only in trusted projects. ([OpenAI Developers][codex-3])                           |
| `.codex/rules/*.rules`                       | Rules for allowing/prompting/blocking commands outside the sandbox.                                                   | `.rules` are experimental command rules; Codex scans `rules/` alongside the active config layer, including `<repo>/.codex/rules/`.

| `.agents/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`            | Repo skills: repeatable workflows, runbooks, checklists, and specialized procedures.                                  | Codex reads repo skills from `.agents/skills` from the current directory to the repository root; a skill is a folder with `SKILL.md` and optional `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`. ([OpenAI Developers][codex-6]) |
| `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`           | Repo marketplace plugin catalog for the team/project.                                                                 | A repo-scoped marketplace can be saved to `$REPO_ROOT/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`; entries point to plugin folders, often under `./plugins/`.

## Agy

### Installation

The VS Code extension is not installed (it does not exist).

The CLI (`agy`) is installed **automatically** in the devcontainer using `.devcontainer/post-create-ai-agents.sh` > `# install Antigravity CLI`.

### Logging In

You need to create a google account on [accounts.google.com](https://accounts.google.com) - i.e., having a standard personal google account is sufficient. **Antigravity can be used for free** via your personal google account (Individual plan), but you must expect limits and availability based on capacity, or you can pay for one of the [plans](https://antigravity.google/pricing). **For work use**, request to have your personal user added to the [company users](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam) (Company plan).

When logging into `agy`, select `2. Use a Google Cloud project`, use the personal account created on [accounts.google.com](https://accounts.google.com), and enter `project-605967c9-39ce-4929-b5b` as the project ID.

On the Company plan, you can track the [current price (consumption) for services used](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/reports).

#### Initial Company plan setup

For the google account you decide to use for the Company plan, you need to do the following in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/):

- [Create a project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate), e.g., `Run AI`.
- [Link a billing account to it](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing), e.g., `Run billing`.
- Enable `Agent platform API`: [console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard?cloudshell=true) (the `|>_|` icon in the top right) > `gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com`

### Commands

Commands ("slash commands") for standard work with the `agy` CLI are:

- **select model:** `/model`
- **set default model:** no separate action needed — the model selected via `/model` persists across sessions
- **allow full permissions:**
  - fast version: `agy --dangerously-skip-permissions`
  - slower version: `/config` > `Tools Permission` > `always-proceed`
  - controlled version: `/permissions` > `Project` > `allowlist` > `command(*)`, `read_file(*)`, `write_file(*)`, `read_url(*)`, `mcp(*)`
- **new line in prompt:** `Alt Enter`
- **select conversation:** `/resume`
- **new conversation:** `/clear`
- **rename conversation:** `/rename`
- **save conversation:** saves automatically
- **compact conversation:** has no built-in command
- **create a copy of conversation:** `/fork`
- **copy last response:** `/copy`
- **save conversation to file:** has no built-in command, but you can use the added `/run-save-chat` skill. Before running `/run-save-chat`, it is recommended to create a copy of the conversation using `/fork` so that the history of the original conversation remains untouched
- **code-review:** has no built-in command, but you can use the added `/run-review-changes` skill
- **list and select skill:** `/skills`
- **show usage/credits:** `/usage` – current session's token usage and remaining credits
- **update:** `agy update`
- **debugging:** has no built-in way, but as a fallback you can use `script -q -f ./agy-session.log -c agy` and in `.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json` set `{"altScreenMode": "never", "verbosity": "high"}`
- **exit work:** `/exit`

See also other added skills in `.agents/skills`. The added commands in `.agents/commands` are not supported in the `agy` CLI (Antigravity workflows, the closest equivalent, only work in the Antigravity IDE, not the CLI).

### Configuration

Antigravity can be configured as follows:

| File / folder                     | Purpose                                                                                 | Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

([Google Codelabs][agy-2])                                                                                                            |
| `.agents/rules/*.md`              | Workspace rules: project rules for code style, architecture, testing, and security.     | Workspace rules live in `.agents/rules/`; global rules are in `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`. ([Google Antigravity][agy-3])                                                                                                            |
| `.agents/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` | Project skills: repeatable abilities/workflows packaged as a directory with `SKILL.md`. | Antigravity currently defaults to `.agents/skills`; a skill is a folder containing `SKILL.md`. ([Google Antigravity][agy-4], [medium][agy-5])                                                                                 |
| `.agents/hooks.json`              | Hooks: local shell scripts run at specified points in the agent execution cycle.        | Hooks are configured in `hooks.json` in the customization directory, e.g., `.agents/` in the workspace. ([Google Antigravity][agy-6])                                                                                         |
| `.agents/mcp_config.json`         | Project MCP configuration, mainly for Antigravity CLI / workspace setup.                | Antigravity uses a separate `mcp_config.json`; IDE documentation mentions global `~/.gemini/antigravity/mcp_config.json`, while CLI/workspace guides also mention project MCP under `.agents/`.
